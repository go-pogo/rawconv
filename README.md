Package `rawconv` implements conversions to and from raw string representations
of any (custom) data types in Go.

```sh
go get github.com/go-pogo/rawconv
```

```go
import "github.com/go-pogo/rawconv"
```

## Key features

- Convert from raw string to out of the box supported types:
  * `string`
  * `bool`
  * `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`
  * `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`
  * `float32`, `float64`
  * `complex64`, `complex128`
  * `time.Duration`
  * `url.URL`
  * `encoding.TextUnmarshaler`
- Globally add support for your own custom types
- Or isolate support for your own custom types via `Marshaler` and `Unmarshaler` instances

```go
var duration time.Duration
if err := rawconv.Unmarshal("1h2m3s", &duration); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("invalid duration: %w", err)
}
```

## Array, slice and map conversions

Conversions to `array`, `slice` or `map` are done by splitting the raw string. The separator can be set via the 
`Options` type and defaults to `DefaultItemsSeparator`. For maps there is also a separator for the key-value pairs, 
which defaults to `DefaultKeyValueSeparator`.
Values within the `array`, `slice`, or `map` are unmarshaled using the called `Unmarshaler`. This is also done for keys 
of maps.
> Nested arrays, slices and maps are not supported.

## Structs

This package does not contain any logic for traversing `struct` types, because the implementation would really depend 
on the use case. However, it is possible to incorporate this package in your own struct unmarshaling logic.

## Custom types

Custom types are supported in two ways; by implementing the `encoding.TextUnmarshaler` and/or `encoding.TextMarshaler`
interfaces, or by registering a `MarshalFunc` with `RegisterMarshalFunc` and/or an `UnmarshalFunc` with
`RegisterUnmarshalFunc`.
If you do not wish to globally expose your `MarshalFunc` or`UnmarshalFunc` implementations, it is possible to register
them to a new `Marshaler` or `Unmarshaler` and use those instances in your application instead.
